# ip-finder
Simple code to find all used IP addresses on the network.

I wanted to share my Django application on the local network only to a few users by allowing their ip adresses. 
Mainly to test and to showcase the Django app. 

Turns out it is a crude way to do it. Takes a long time to run the code. 



Note : An alternate for short time sharing is by using ngrok for port forwarding your django apps default port.
